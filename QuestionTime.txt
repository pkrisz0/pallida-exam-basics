What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]

Your answer:

[A function is a bunch of code you have given a name, so you can reuse it.
A method is a function that belongs to an object. In Java, every function is
a method.]

What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
[Its a method you create an object with. I.e. if you make a class in Java
it has a default constructor. You can create constructors with parameters
that will define the object upon creation.]
